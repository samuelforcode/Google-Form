# Google-like-form.

I've built this just for a learning purpose.
I was going through the Freecodecamp responsive website cours, and at the end of the cours, they give us some projects to build. one of those project was to build a form using only Html5 and CSS3; but I want building something interactive and where I could use and improve my programming skills, then I chose to build this where I could use javaScript too.
it was really fun and give me the confidence to do more.
